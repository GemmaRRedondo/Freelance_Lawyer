# Freelance_Lawyer
My name is Gemma Ruiz Redondo, and I am a lawyer, member of the Col.legi d'Advocats de Barcelona, 
I offer my services as self-employed lawyer, which take place prefereably remotely. 
As for my work experience, I had the opportunity to train in two criminal law firms, where I contributed to very different cases regarding juvenile law and economic criminal law. In addition, I have subsequently worked in civil matters, family law and purchase and sale contracts. 
During my Erasmus in Norway, I was also able to acquire knowledge of both international humanitarian law and international human rights. 
Recently, I have worked as a Lawyer at the Apip-Acam Foundation, specifically in its Ampara Program, to offer legal advice to people seeking international protection. 

I have a great knowladge in languages, i.e. Spanish, English, French, German, Italian and Portuguese. 

In case my profile corresponds to the work you do, don't hesitate to contact me.
